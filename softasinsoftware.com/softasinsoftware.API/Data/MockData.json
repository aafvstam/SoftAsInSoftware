Let's see if we can change this with today's Live Coding session.\n \nTwo weeks ago, we created the Smallest Office Add-in Ever, but we wanted to run it in a secure environment using self-signed certificates. Last week we looked at OpenSSL to create us self-signed certificates and see how this is performing in the context of our Smallest Office Add-in Ever.\n\nCreating a small webserver that serves the Add-in to test on localhost is another thing. The PnP sample currently serves the pages from GitHub Pages. A cool feature to run your repo files directly from the GitHub site.\n\nIf you do want to run on your own machine you will need a small local running server, serving a secure (https!) website.

      "description": "In general, most Office Developer Samples are fairly complex. Today we are going to look at the smallest Add-in with only the basics that you need for creating your starter Add-in.\n\nYou only need a few lines of code, five or ten. That is all to get your first Add-in up and running. Besides that, your Office Host (Excel, Word etc.) needs to know where to look to see your Add-in. For that you need a manifest.xml. This contains all the pointers to where the website is and where it can find assets like buttons or Add-in Title and Description information.\n\nCreating a small webserver that serves the Add-in to test on localhost is another thing. The PnP sample at this time serves the pages from Github Pages.

Many more items need to be researched, for instance Hot Reloading, YouTube APIs, CSS, and Bootstrap Styling and much, much more to go.\n\n#Blazor #Layout",

Using the upcoming .NET 6 version (still in preview at time of this session)\n\nIn this Live Coding session, I create a new Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) website, register my domain, and attach the SSL certificates.\n\nFor the current state you can go to www.softasinsoftware.com and see the progress so far.",

Same errors as in the GH Issue. Using VS 2022 at that time. Switched to VS 2019, rebuilt and that was working both on the client as in the web versions of Outlook. Now a few weeks later it failed again. In this Live Coding session, you'll see that it still is highly unstable and confirming the issue is valid.\n\nUpdate: A fix was added just after the Live Coding session:\nhttps://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/pull/205\nTested that off camera, found another remaining issue and I fixed this as well:\nhttps://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/pull/206\n\nBoth these fixes solved the issues I showed here in this Live Coding sessions.\nWill do a recap in another video to show that it is working now.",
